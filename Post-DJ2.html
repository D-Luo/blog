        <h1 class="title">War of Information: How Can Journalism 
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Win Back Its Audiences?</h1>
            <p>There has been a paradox for journalism: audiences face a world flooded with content and information,
                and yet the profession that should be the best skilled and most dedicated to helping them make sense 
                of it all finds itself under great pressure, attacked on several fronts. These growing challenges are 
                becoming universal in journalism: huge losses of revenue; worldwide technological disruption; and, most 
                devastatingly, growing doubts about journalism’s quality, impartiality, and authority (Nielsen et al. 2020).             
            </p><br>
            <p>Printed content once dominated the world of information and even helped to form the modern idea of nationalism 
                (Anderson 2016), with journalism at the forefront. In the last two decades, however, the rise to prominence of 
                the internet has begun a competition for the attention of the news consuming public, and journalists are losing. 
                From 2013 to 2021, print media halved and TV news declined in popularity as a news source in the UK, with the 
                share of social media doubling in the same period. Additionally, there is almost no growth of online news platforms —
                the main front now for the mainstream media (Newman et al. 2021).
            </p><br>
            <p>How, then, can the industry turn the tide and regain the trust of the public? A simple answer is to provide what the 
                public wants and needs most - to be informed about events and threats as soon as possible, both locally and internationally, 
                and with in-depth stories (Nelson 2021). I will detail four potential ways of achieving this.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
        <h2>Smarter and Deeper</h2>
            <p>New technology like the artificial intelligence (Elmqvist et al.) should be used more extensively in journalism. News items 
                like stock information, weather forecasts, sports results etc. can be produced automatically by software, something news organizations 
                like the Washington Post and Forbes already do, by using algorisms to analyse data and generate news content (Carlson 2015). Such 
                technology means that news organizations can now produce news smarter and faster, satisfying their “long-tail” readers while using 
                less manpower and other resources.
            </p><br>
            <p>Many are concerned that AI might replace human journalists, but there is more opportunity than danger in this trend. The rising 
                technology has the potential to free journalists from redundant and repetitive work, letting them be more investigative, and focus 
                more on deeper stories behind the scenes. Combined with the rise of slow journalism, audiences interested in facts and truth underneath 
                the surface might be drawn back to news stories.
            </p><br><br><br>
        <h3>Collaborate with Others</h3>
            <p>The internet has narrowed the distance between continents and countries, and journalists should also make use of this. Collaboration with 
                other journalists and news organizations across the world means the establishment of a giant global market, and most importantly, journalists 
                can dig out stories globally and put them together with minimal additional resources required. The Pandora Papers investigation, with more 
                than 600 journalists in 117 countries and territories working together to uncover the financial secrets of global elites (Shiel 2021), 
                provides a perfect example of industry cooperation.  
            </p><br>
            <p>Multiple language services could be developed for international news organizations like the BBC. Worldwide partnerships with other news 
                media should be made, as Sir Howard stringer suggested in his report on the BBC International services in 2014 (Stringer 2014). It is 
                reasonable and profitable for large markets like South America to build a non-English news service. Moreover, reliable, and impartial 
                local news partners from smaller markets mean that news can be gathered more quickly, without many employees, and that news from 
                elsewhere can be delivered in time to local audiences.
            </p><br>
            <p>Meanwhile, traditional news organizations should embrace social media, and this means cooperation with other industries. Tech companies 
                are trying to provide paid news content to users, either using integrated functions of social media applications like Facebook News Tab, 
                or independent applications like Apple News plus. This could be a hitch ride for journalism.
            </p><br><br><br>
        <h3>Tackle Fake News</h3>
            <p>Part of the reason for the declining regard of audiences for traditional journalism is that audiences are wary of untrustworthy news. 
                People want and deserve the clear, unmanipulated truth. For this reason, fake news is a serious enemy of professional journalism, 
                and we should oppose it, not just for ourselves, but also for the public (Zhang and Ghorbani 2020). 
            </p><br>
            <p>At the industry level, consensus should be reached that there is no place for fake or partial news content, no matter how big the 
                disagreement in political opinions or conflict of interest is for news producers. This does appear to be a formidable task, but 
                the world is broken enough, and journalists cannot and should not be the ones to tear it apart.
            </p><br>
            <p>More practically, journalists should use their professional knowledge and skills to tackle fake news. News organisations can build 
                specialised fact-checking departments to investigate potential inauthentic news and provide the truth to the public. Naturally, 
                the audience can also provide relevant information, which might enhance interaction between journalists and the public. Furthermore, 
                the automatic detection of fake news should also be put into wider practice (Pérez-Rosas et al. 2017).

        <h3>Try to Eliminate Mistakes</h3>
            <p>Last but not least, attempt to make no mistakes. The public, or at least certain sections of it, are highly sceptical about news, 
                and when news is related to certain individuals or groups, there are always huge interests behind it. No matter how much information 
                we deliver to the public, or how quickly, it is for nought if the news provided isn’t accurate.
            </p><br>
            <p>Eyes are on us and our works, meaning that journalists can’t afford to make any mistakes.  Unfortunately, these mistakes are common. 
                From the former BBC journalist Martin Bashir's interview with Princess Diana to the misidentification of Lord McAlpine; from Jayson 
                Blair of The New York Times’ plagiarism scandal to the phone-hacking scandal of News of the World (Cathcart 2012), journalists are 
                losing credit from the public because of our misbehaviour.
            </p><br>
            <p>For a news story, it’s not just the accuracy of content, but also the validity of the production process that matters, as emphasised 
                in almost every guideline for journalists. To some degree, the theory of procedural justice also applies to journalism. Journalists 
                can’t threaten others to get to the truth, just as confessions extracted by torture are not legally valid evidence in court.
            </p><br>
            <p>On the other hand, we should respond with speed and strength when there is a mistake. Although nowadays almost every news organisation 
                has guidelines for journalists, that’s far from enough. There should be more strict regulations, even laws, for journalism, not to 
                restrict press freedom, but to ensure the process and outcome of journalism are solid.
            </p>
            <p>Both journalists and the public should know that once a news story goes wrong, there will be consequences and whoever is responsible 
                will be punished. By providing impartial, spotless news and imposing serious penalties on those who make mistakes, journalists can 
                prove that they are trustworthy and ease doubts from the public about their quality, impartiality, and authority.
            </p><br>
            <p>To conclude, to regain the trust of the public and retake its dwindling market share, journalism should adapt to the rapidly changing 
                technology and market, while also improving itself. Journalism should have a place in the future, people inside the industry should 
                do their utmost to ensure that.
